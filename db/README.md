# Database

This folder contains all the content to generate the data for the database and create it. Go here to look at setup [instructions](/README.md), where we run the [setup.sh](/db/setup.sh) file. The data is all stored in the [data](/db/data/) folder, and you can look at our scripts to generate the data [here](/db/generated/gen.py). If you look at [create.sql](/db/create.sql), you can see our schema for the database. 

Below is a diagram of our database![file](/nile_er.png)
